# Dotfiles
Dotfiles for friends and strangers to reference. Used on Arch GNU/Linux.

I would NOT recommend installing and copying willy-nilly. Things will break. I have made no attempt at an install script, and this repo is meant to be used as inspiration rather than for distribution.

## Applications Included
- Bash
- Eww
- Foot
- Hyprland
- Mako
- Neovim
- Wofi
- Zathura

## Notes
- If you can't find a folder for something I say is in here, it is likely present as a template in the `wal` folder. I symlink the filled in templates that wal creates to the correct location in my config files, so I don't have to manually move files each time I swap themes or otherwise use wal.
- I use Pywalfox with wal to theme my Firefox. There is no config for it.
